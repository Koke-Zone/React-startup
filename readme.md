    # React Startup 

    React CDNs (react & reactDom)
    Call app.js after the CDNs are called (links then app.js called)
    createElement, reactDOM.createRoot (reactDOM is case-sensitive otherwise shows error), render
    When we render any thing it will replaced the html if any thing exists inside it.
